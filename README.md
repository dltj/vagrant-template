## Contact

People may want to reach out to you for various reasons, ranging from DCMA take down notices to questions about how to donate to your project. Provide contact information, such as an email address, and keep in mind that some countries may require certain information by law, such as a full postal address, website URL, and company name.

## License

This project is licensed under [insert license]. The license should be in a separate file called LICENSE, so don't explain it in detail within your documentation. Also, don't forget to specify licenses of third-party libraries and programs you use.

Sometimes including a Table of Contents (TOC) at the beginning of the documentation makes sense, especially when your README file is more than a few paragraphs. If you think that the README file has grown too large, put some of the more detailed parts, such as installation or configuration sections, into their own files.
